# Motivation

I am using this repo to learn the library called `react-query`. My plan is to use it moving forward in my projects.

The library promises lofty features that I hope to integrate in my own work.

## Contents

Below I will create an ordered list of things that I learned and features that I used.

1. `react-query` context component and where to place it.
2. How to fetch data by using the `useQuery` hook.
3. Mutate the data within an existing `useQuery`. This functionality is used when we need to add, update or delete data from a remote API.
